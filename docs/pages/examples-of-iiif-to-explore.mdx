# IIIF content to Explore

## TU Delft

Given our location for the workshop today, where better to start than at TU Delft - you can navigate their IIIF collection from here: (https://heritage.tudelft.nl/iiif/collection.json )

Using Theseus from the viewer tools, you can navigate through the collection - simply open Theseus and paste in the Collection URL or use the link:

## Leiden University Libraries

IIIF Manifest URL is presented as part of a link to an advanced viewer (Mirador) in this item view, which you can use to access the Manifest, for example:

## WikiData

As mentioned on the IIIF Guides, Wikidata has a property for IIIF Manifests which enables queries to be created that filter and retrieve manifests if they match other Wikidata properties. You can use the examples listed here: https://iiif.io/guides/guides/www.wikidata.org/ which generate links to the manifest using the Mirador viewer.

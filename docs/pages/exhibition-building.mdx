# Exhibition building

## Accessing the Exhibition editor

From the Manifest Editor, when you are ready to access the Exhibition editing tools to work on the IIIF Manifest you've created, click on the 'Settings cog' in the bottom left hand menu. This opens the Workspace configuration for the Manifest Editor. Clicking the link 'Go to Exhibition Editor' will open your Manifest in the editor:

## Introduction to the Exhibition editing mode

The left hand panel allows interaction with the individual “slides” (aka Canvases) that make up the exhibition. These are simply the canvases which are present in the IIIF Manifest you are editing. 

The centre panel presents the contents of the IIIF Manifest, whilst the right hand side metadata panel presents the Manifest metadata.

### Editing the exhibition

Clicking the Exhibition grid icon on the left navigation, opens the Exhibition grid view where you can see an outline of your exhibition.

There are a number of controls:

- 'Grid view' which enables you to view the exhibition as a grid, essentially providing a "Preview" of the exhibition you are creating. 
- 'List view' you can toggle the 'Grid view' to display the slides in the exhibition as a list.
- 'Edit slides' allows you to reorganise and update the order of the "slides" (aka Canvases) within the manifest.
- 'Add a new slide' enables you to add content as slides to your exhibition manifest.

:::info
If you want to remove a slide (canvas) from your exhibition, you currently need to do this in the standard Manifest Editor view, using the "Edit Canvases" option, in the left hand panel.

When you click on a slide in the left hand panel (or via the centre grid view), the right hand panel presents additional exhibition specific metadata options for each slide.

## Creating and updating your Exhibition manifest

The first thing you will note is the initial “title” information box, which is preset to the current yellow background and it presents the IIIF Manifest title. This is the default setting for the Exhibition introduction and we'll explain a little bit more about that during the workshop.
